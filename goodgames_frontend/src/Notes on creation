FOOTER

It's great to have little details like a copyright footer to make this feel like a real website. I want the footer
to display at the bottom of every page, but two of my components are colored, meaning the footer there is this jarring
white bar with text at the bottom of the page--it doesn't sit within the background image and looks ugly. I couldn't figure out for the life of me
how to make the footer stay in App every time while accounting for this, so I came up with a way that worked for me.

I just made a new key in state called showDefaultFooter, represented as a boolean. Then, at the bottom of App,
I had a conditional that goes like this "is showDefaultFooter true? If it is, then render Footer here. If it isn't
don't return anything!" Then, in my Login and Signup components, I imported Footer and colored the text white, placing it
at the bottom of each component. To prevent the Footer from App showing up, I had each component inherit the hideDefaultFooter
and unhideDefaultFooter methods, the former of which sets App.state.showDefaultFooter to false, and the other which reverts it to true.

In componentDidMount, I fire off hideDefaultFooter so App.state.showDefaultFooter is false, meaning only the Footer in Login/Signup
shows. When we we render to somewhere else by filling out these forms, I use the componentWillUnmount method which sets
App.state.showDefaultFooter back to true so when other components render, the Footer is where it should be.
